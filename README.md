# RecordForge

### Generate realistic test files in seconds. No fake data leaks.

A Windows desktop app and Python package by [Michael Nocito](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelnocito).

To create: a wide hero banner (~1600×500). Left side shows stacked
sample outputs (an invoice PDF, a contract Word doc, and an Excel
sheet with customer rows); right side shows the 3-step wizard UI
(Mode & Type → Settings → Generate). Project name + tagline overlaid.

> ⚠️ All output is synthetic and fictional. Never use for legal, financial, medical, regulatory, or identity purposes.

You can generate a folder full of realistic — but completely fictional —
business documents and data sets in a few clicks. Invoices, purchase
orders, contracts, offer letters, customer records, transactions, even
intentionally messy spreadsheets for cleanup drills.

Pick what you need, how many, and where to save them. The app handles
the rest. You end up with test files you can drop straight into a QA
run, a demo, or a training session — no real customer data involved.

---

## Two Ways to Use It

Pick whichever fits you. Both produce the same files.

- **Desktop app (Windows installer)** — You can run it without Python.
  Download, click, generate files. Jump to
  [Download & Install](#%EF%B8%8F-download--install-windows).
- **Python package** — Install with pip, use the CLI or the Python API,
  extend it with your own types.
  Jump to [Run from Python](#run-from-python-developers).

---

## See It In Action

Open the app and you get a 3-step wizard: pick your file types, choose
how many and what format, then generate. Names, addresses, and party
details are randomized for every file. Output lands in the folder you
choose, and you can open any file directly from the app the moment it
finishes.

VISUAL PLACEMENT 2 — Product screenshot or short GIF
Future path: docs/images/wizard.png (or wizard.gif)
Alt text: 3-step wizard generating fictional PDFs and Excel data files
To create: a screenshot or 8–12s GIF of the running app showing
the Mode & Type → Settings → Generate flow. End on the success
state with the generated file list visible. PNG is fine; GIF is
better if easy to record.

## ⬇️ Download & Install (Windows)

1. Go to [**Releases**](https://github.com/michaelnocito/recordforge/releases/latest)
2. Download `RecordForgeSetup.exe`
3. Double-click the installer and follow the wizard (Next → Next → Finish)
4. Launch from the **Desktop shortcut** or **Start Menu**

You do not need Python for this path. Works on Windows 10 and Windows 11.

> **Blank white screen after launch?** Your machine may be missing the
> Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime — this is required by the app.
> [Download it free from Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)
> and reinstall. See [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for more help.

## How It Works

Three steps, one folder of test files at the end.

VISUAL PLACEMENT 3 — Simple workflow diagram
Future path: docs/images/workflow.svg (preferred) or docs/images/workflow.png
Alt text: Choose file types and settings, generate fictional documents and data, use in QA demos and training
To create: a clean horizontal flow diagram showing:
  [Choose Types & Format] → [Generate Fictional Files] → [Use in QA / Demo / Training]
Keep it friendly and non-technical. Use simple icons for each stage
(checklist → gear/sparkle → laptop/clipboard). Excalidraw, Figma, or
a clean Keynote/PowerPoint export works well.
When ready, replace this comment with:
![Choose file types and settings, generate fictional documents and data, use in QA demos and training](docs/images/workflow.svg)
-->

**Step 1 — Mode & Type**
- Choose **Documents**, **Data Files**, or **Both**
- Select the types you want (pick as many as you need)

**Step 2 — Settings**
- Set how many files per type (1–20)
- Choose a document format: **PDF**, **Word .docx**, or **HTML**
  - Skip this if you are only generating data files
- Set your output folder (defaults to `~/Documents/recordforge`)

**Step 3 — Review & Generate**
- Confirm your selections in the summary
- Click **Generate Test Files**
- Click any file or **Open Output Folder** when done

---

## What You Can Generate

**Documents** (PDF / Word `.docx` / HTML)

- Invoice
- Purchase Order
- Intake Form
- SOP
- Contract
- Offer Letter

**Data files** (Excel `.xlsx`)

- Customer Records
- Vendor Master
- Transactions
- Employee Records
- Inventory
- Messy Data — nulls, duplicates, bad formatting (great for cleanup testing)

Every org name, address, contact, and party detail is randomly generated
per file. Pick an output folder, then open files directly from the app
when generation finishes.

---

## Who This Is For

- **QA engineers** who want varied, realistic test files without scrubbing real data
- **Sales and solutions teams** building demos that can't use customer documents
- **Trainers and bootcamps** running data-cleaning, document-processing, or migration exercises
- **Developers** testing import pipelines, OCR, parsers, or doc workflows on safe sample data

If you build, test, or teach with documents and data, you can use this
to skip the busywork of hand-crafting sample files and focus on the
work that matters.

## Run from Python (Developers)

Requires Python 3.11+ and pip.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/michaelnocito/recordforge.git
cd recordforge
pip install -e .
```

**CLI:**

```
recordforge generate --type invoice --format pdf --count 5
recordforge generate --type customers --format xlsx --count 2
recordforge list-types
```

**Python API:**

```python
from recordforge import generate

docs = generate(type="invoice", format="pdf", count=3, output="./out")
for doc in docs:
    print(doc.path)
```

**Desktop UI:**

```
python -m recordforge
```

To build your own EXE or installer, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Safety & Privacy

- No real personal data is ever used in generated output
- No network calls — generation is fully offline (the optional **Check for Updates** button just opens the Releases page in your browser)
- User-entered output folder paths are not stored or transmitted
- Generated files stay on your machine in the folder you choose
- See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for full details
