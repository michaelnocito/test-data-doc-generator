# CLAUDE.md — RecordForge

Rules for Claude Code. Read this before touching any file.

---

## Project

Python package that generates synthetic documents and data files for
data engineering and ETL testing. See SPEC.md for full architecture.

---

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. **Read SPEC.md first.** Every architectural decision is already made.
   Do not invent structure not in the spec.

2. **No monoliths.** Every module has one job. If a function is growing
   past ~40 lines, it probably belongs in a different module.

3. **No global mutable state.** All randomness flows through the `rng`
   parameter. Never call `random.random()`, `random.choice()`, or any
   `random` module global directly. Always use the instance from
   `core/seed.py`.

4. **No hardcoded dollar amounts or strings in generators.** All
   financial values must be computed from `LineItem` dataclasses.
   "Implementation Services ... $12,500" is a v1 bug, not a feature.

5. **Watermark on every PDF page.** Non-negotiable. See SPEC.md watermark
   spec. Test this with multi-page outputs.

6. **Never break the existing UI contract.** The pywebview `generate()`
   method in `ui/app.py` must return the same JSON shape as v1:
   `{"success": bool, "files": list[str], "folder": str}` or
   `{"success": false, "error": str, "files": []}`.

---

## Python Style

- Python 3.11+ features are fine: `X | Y` unions, `match`, `tomllib`.
- Type hints on every function signature — parameters and return type.
- Dataclasses for all data models (`@dataclass`, not dicts, not
  namedtuples).
- `Decimal` for all currency math. Never `float` for money.
- `pathlib.Path` everywhere. Never `os.path.join`.
- f-strings for all string formatting.
- No `print()` in library code. CLI output goes through Typer's echo.
  UI output goes through the pywebview return value.
- Imports: stdlib → third-party → local, one blank line between groups.
- No wildcard imports (`from x import *`).

---

## File / Naming Conventions

- Module names: `snake_case`
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Functions and variables: `snake_case`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Type aliases: `PascalCase`

---

## Error Handling

- All `generate()` paths (CLI, API, UI) must catch exceptions and
  return/raise cleanly — never let a stack trace reach the user
  without a message.
- Validation errors (bad type, bad format combo) should raise
  `ValueError` with a clear message before any file I/O starts.
- File I/O errors should be caught and reported with the failing path.

---

## Testing

- Write at minimum one smoke test per generator module:
  `build(rng)` returns a valid `DocumentData` instance.
- Write one test per renderer: output file exists and is non-empty.
- Write one test for watermark: PDF contains the string "SAMPLE" when
  read back as text (use `pdfminer` or `pypdf` if needed, or just check
  file size is non-trivial).
- Seed tests: same seed → same output filename stem and same line item
  totals.
- Test file: `tests/test_smoke.py` (single file for Phase A).

---

## What to Preserve from v1 (Do Not Refactor)

- `sanitize_filename()` — copy exactly, do not change behavior.
- `open_path()` platform detection — copy exactly.
- XLSX auto-width column logic.
- All 6 document type keys (strings must match exactly):
  `invoice`, `purchase_order`, `intake_form`, `sop`, `contract`,
  `offer_letter`
- All 6 data type keys:
  `customers`, `vendors`, `transactions`, `employees`, `inventory`,
  `messy`

---

## What Not to Do

- Do not use `argparse` — CLI is Typer only.
- Do not use `flask`, `fastapi`, or any web framework.
- Do not make network calls anywhere.
- Do not store or log user file paths.
- Do not add dependencies not in SPEC.md without flagging it.
- Do not use `WeasyPrint` — PDF renderer is `reportlab` only.
- Do not use `platypus.canvas` line-by-line for the PDF body — use
  `SimpleDocTemplate` + Flowables.
- Do not skip the watermark on any PDF page including page 2+.
- Do not use `float` for any currency value.

---

## Commit Style

- One logical change per commit.
- Message format: `type: short description`
  - `feat:` new capability
  - `fix:` bug fix
  - `refactor:` restructure without behavior change
  - `chore:` rename, move, cleanup
- Example: `feat: add PDF line-item table with computed totals`

---

## Phase A Exit Criteria

Phase A is complete when:

1. `pip install -e .` succeeds from repo root.
2. `recordforge generate --type invoice --format pdf --count 3` produces
   3 PDF files, each with a visible diagonal SAMPLE watermark, a header
   block, a line-item table, and a computed Total Due.
3. `recordforge generate --type customers --format xlsx --count 2`
   produces 2 XLSX files.
4. `from recordforge import generate; generate(type="invoice", format="pdf")`
   works in a Python REPL.
5. `python -m recordforge` launches the desktop UI with RecordForge
   branding.
6. `pytest tests/` passes.
7. Repo renamed to `recordforge`, README updated, v2.0.0 tagged.
